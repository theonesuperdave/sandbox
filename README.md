I play a lot here. Tech research, proof-of-concepts, etc. It's like a playground for nerds.

### RivetsJS
Just a basic web app using rivets

### RivetsJSConDurandalJS
An implementation of DurandalJS using RivetsJS for everything but the compose binding. Several variations of data-binding and AMD modules are in play.

### KarmaWithMocha
This is a simple setup using Karma for the test framework and Mocha as the test runner. Since requireJS is a thing, there is the config and example of that as well. Grunt is also an option for running Mocha here, but it doesn't play well with requireJS, so examples are limited.
